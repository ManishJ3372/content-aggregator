# content-aggregator
A content aggregator is an entity that pulls together web or media content, applications or both from online sources for reuse or resale. It’s a means of curating content. Two types of content aggregators exist:

those who gather news and other materials from various sources for publication on their own Web sites
those who syndicate content, gathering and distributing material that suits their customers’ needs
Content aggregation involves collecting materials in one place, such as:

blogs
newsletters
newspaper and magazine articles
social media posts

It’s possible to aggregate content manually, but in today’s data-driven world, automated content aggregation, with the help of software tools, is more common and practical.
